# ImageTrainingClassifier
This code is meant for a data set of glycan molecule diagrams for a search application on the website: GlyGen. The MATLAB code will take a group of images with one example of each class and then make multiple distorted images to train a neuro network. The neuro network will be able to classify new unseen images into classes.
